                        coffee drinks, drink customizations, and a shopping cart. The driver class used the other object classes to simulate an online ordering system. I successfully created
                        and implemented the object classes to create a functioning CoffeeKisok application. I enjoyed this
                        project because of its clear real-world application, and I learned about one way a program for an online shopping experience might function.

                    I researched common practices in ballet companies, traditions in ballet culture that have racist origins, and how the current movement is shifting away from some of
                    these troublesome practices. With this research I wrote a report on the topic and presented the analysis to the class.
